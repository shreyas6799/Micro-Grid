This is the simulation for micro grid
The software used in this project is Proteus and Arduino IDE. Proteus software which is used for circuit simulation where programs are stored in the memory of microcontroller. The speed of Proteus software is fast and its accurate. In Proteus, we can simulate the electrical and electronic circuits more accurately. In Arduino Ide software we can write the program and upload that program in Arduino boards. It uses C Programming language in Arduino IDE. It helps to connect the hardware component Arduino to upload the program and to execute the program.
