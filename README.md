A microgrid is a localized group of electric loads and distributed energy resources (DERs) with clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. A microgrid can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid-connected or island mode.

DERs are small-scale power generation and storage technologies that can be located close to where they are used, such as solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and diesel generators. Microgrids can also include energy management systems (EMS) that help to optimize the operation of the DERs and ensure that the microgrid meets the needs of its customers.

Microgrids can offer a number of benefits, including:

Reliability: Microgrids can help to improve reliability by providing backup power in the event of a grid outage.
Resilience: Microgrids can make the grid more resilient to cyberattacks and natural disasters.
Sustainability: Microgrids can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by integrating renewable energy sources.
Economic benefits: Microgrids can help to reduce energy costs and create jobs.
Microgrids are becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve the reliability, resilience, sustainability, and affordability of the electric grid. They are being used in a variety of settings, including college campuses, hospitals, businesses, and communities.

Here are some examples of how microgrids are being used to improve the reliability, resilience, sustainability, and affordability of the electric grid:

College campuses: Microgrids can help college campuses to reduce their energy costs and become more self-sufficient. For example, the University of California, Berkeley has a microgrid that includes solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage. The microgrid can provide up to 100% of the campus's electricity needs on sunny days.
Hospitals: Microgrids can help hospitals to ensure that critical medical devices continue to operate in the event of a grid outage. For example, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has a microgrid that includes solar panels, a diesel generator, and a battery storage system. The microgrid can provide backup power to the NIH's main hospital and critical research facilities.
Businesses: Microgrids can help businesses to reduce their energy costs and improve their reliability. For example, the Googleplex, Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, has a microgrid that includes solar panels, a wind turbine, and a battery storage system. The microgrid can provide up to 100% of the Googleplex's electricity needs on sunny days.
Communities: Microgrids can help communities to become more resilient to grid outages and natural disasters. For example, the town of Rockport, Massachusetts has a microgrid that includes solar panels, battery storage, and a diesel generator. The microgrid can provide backup power to the town's critical infrastructure, such as the hospital, water treatment plant, and emergency shelter.
Microgrids are still a relatively new technology, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we generate and distribute electricity.
